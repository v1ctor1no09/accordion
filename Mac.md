  * Keys: F/Bb/Eb, G/C/F, A/D/G, C#/D/G, B/C/C#, C System, B System
  * Instruments: Standard midi set, defaults to accordion

## Playing ##
> Hold the keyboard facing away from you with the Esc button at the top. Play the keys, waggling the space bar as it were the bellows. The escape key, the control key and the alt key may also be used as the bellows. If you don't know how to play button accordion, see http://info.melodeon.net.

> The latest Mac version includes bass on the function keys, but I discovered while testing on a Macbook that there not a lot of point because all the keys appear to have hard coded functions assigned to them. And the display is in the way. The bass now works on the number keys.
